\usage{
compare_gvar(
  fit_a,
  fit_b,
  cutoff = 5,
  dec_rule = "or",
  n_draws = 1000,
  comp = "frob",
  return_all = FALSE,
  sampling_method = "random",
  indices = NULL,
  burnin = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit_a}{Fitted model object for Model A. This can be a tsnet_fit object
(obtained from [stan_gvar()]), a BGGM object (obtained from
[BGGM::var_estimate()]), or extracted posterior samples (obtained from
[stan_fit_convert()).}

\item{fit_b}{Fitted model object for Model B. This can be a tsnet_fit object
(obtained from [stan_gvar()]), a BGGM object (obtained from
[BGGM::var_estimate()]), or extracted posterior samples (obtained from
[stan_fit_convert()).}

\item{cutoff}{The percentage level of the test (default: 5\%) as integer.}

\item{dec_rule}{The decision rule to be used. Currently supports default "or"
(comparing against two reference distributions) and "comb" (combining the
reference distributions). The use of "or" is recommended, as "comb" is less
stable.}

\item{n_draws}{The number of draws to use for reference distributions
(default: 1000).}

\item{comp}{The distance metric to use. Should be one of "frob" (Frobenius
norm), "maxdiff" (maximum  difference), or "l1" (L1 norm) (default:
"frob"). The use of the Frobenius norm is recommended.}

\item{return_all}{Logical indicating whether to return all distributions
(default: FALSE). Has to be set to TRUE for plotting the results.}

\item{sampling_method}{Draw sequential pairs of samples from the posterior,
with certain distance between them ("sequential") or randomly from two
halves of the posterior ("random"). The "random" method is preferred to
account for potential autocorrelation between subsequent samples. Default:
"random".}

\item{indices}{A list of "beta" and "pcor" indices specifying which elements
of the matrices to consider when calculating distances. If NULL (default),
all elements of both matrices are considered. If provided, only the
elements at these indices are considered. If only one of the matrices
should have indices, the other one should be NULL. This can be useful if
you want to calculate distances based on a subset of the elements in the
matrices.}

\item{burnin}{The number of burn-in iterations to discard (default: 0).}
}
\value{
A list (of class "compare_gvar") containing the results of the
  comparison. The list includes:
 \itemize{
  \item{sig_beta}{Binary decision on whether there is a significant difference between the temporal networks of A and B}
  \item{sig_pcor}{Binary decision on whether there is a significant difference between the contemporaneous networks of A and B}
  \item{res_beta}{The null distribution for the temporal networks for both models}
  \item{res_pcor}{The null distribution for the contemporaneous networks for both models}
  \item{emp_beta}{The empirical distance between the two temporal networks}
  \item{emp_pcor}{The empirical distance between the two contemporaneous networks}
  \item{larger_beta}{The number of reference distances larger than the empirical distance for the temporal network}
  \item{larger_pcor}{The number of reference distances larger than the empirical distance for the temporal network}
  \item{arguments}{The arguments used in the function call}
   }
}
\description{
This function compares two Bayesian Graphical Vector
  Autoregressive models using matrix norms to test if the observed
  differences between two models is reliable. It computes the empirical
  distance between two models based on their point estimates and compares
  them using reference distributions created from their posterior
  distributions. Returns the p-value for the comparison based on a decision
  rule specified by the user. Details are available in Siepe, Kloft & Heck (2023)
