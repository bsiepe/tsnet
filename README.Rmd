The goal of `tsnet` is to include helpful functions for dynamic network modelling in psychology and surrounding fields. The package contains functionality to estimate Bayesian GVAR models in Stan, as well as a test for network comparison. Additionally, the package includes functions to plot posterior estimates and centrality indices. More information is provided in the associated preprint [Siepe et al. (2024)](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/uwfjc/).

## Installation

You can install the released version of `tsnet` from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("tsnet")
```

You can install the development version of `tsnet` from [GitHub](https://github.com/bsiepe/tsnet) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bsiepe/tsnet")
```

The installation may take some time as the models are compiled upon installation. 

## Getting Started

### Estimating Network Models with Stan

The package includes the `stan_gvar` function that can be used to estimate a GVAR model with Stan. We use `rstan` as a backend. More details are included in the package documentation and the associated preprint.

```{r example-fit, eval = FALSE}
library(tsnet)

# Load example data
data(ts_data)

# use data of first individual
data <- subset(ts_data, id == "ID1")

# Estimate network
fit_stan <- stan_gvar(data[,-7],
                 cov_prior = "IW",
                 iter_warmup = 500,
                 iter_sampling = 500,
                 n_chains = 4)

# print summary
print(fit_stan)

```


### Comparing Network Models

This is an example of how to use the package to compare two network models. We here use `BGGM` to estimate the networks, but the `stan_gvar` function can be used as well.

```{r example-test, eval = FALSE}
library(tsnet)

# Load simulated time series data of two individuals
data(ts_data)
data_1 <- subset(ts_data, id == "ID1")
data_2 <- subset(ts_data, id == "ID2")

# Estimate networks
# (should perform detrending etc. in a real use case)
net_1 <- stan_gvar(data_1[,-7],
                   iter_sampling = 1000,
                   n_chains = 4)
net_2 <- stan_gvar(data_2[,-7],
                   iter_sampling = 1000,
                   n_chains = 4)

# Plot individual temporal network estimates
post_plot_1 <- posterior_plot(net_1)
```

You can then compare these networks, summarize the results and plot the test results. In this case, the test is significant for both the temporal and the contemporaneous network.
```{r compare, eval = FALSE}
# Compare networks
compare_13 <- compare_gvar(net_1, 
                           net_2,
                           return_all = TRUE,
                           n_draws = 1000)

# Print summary of results
print(compare_13)

# Plot test results
test_plot_13 <- plot(compare_13,
                     name_a = "Model A",
                     name_b = "Model B")
```
