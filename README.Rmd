# tsnet

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of tsnet is to include helpful functions for dynamic network modelling in psychology and surrounding fields. Currently, the core of the package is the comparison of Bayesian gVAR models as estimated in the `BGGM` package. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of `tsnet` from [GitHub](https://github.com/bsiepe/tsnet) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bsiepe/tsnet")
```

## Getting Started

This is an example of how to use the package to compare two network models:

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
library(BGGM)
library(tsnet)


# Load data of two individuals
data <- BGGM::ifit
data_1 <- subset(data, id == 1)
data_3 <- subset(data, id == 3)

# Estimate networks
# (should perform detrending etc. in a real use case)
net_1 <- BGGM::var_estimate(data_1[,-1],
                            rho_sd = 0.25, 
                            beta_sd = 0.5,
                            iter = 50000)
net_3 <- BGGM::var_estimate(data_3[,-1],
                            rho_sd = 0.25, 
                            beta_sd = 0.5,
                            iter = 50000)

# Plot individual temporal network estimates
post_plot_1 <- tsnet::posterior_plot(net_1)

```

You can then compare these networks, summarize the results and plot the test results:
```{r compare, eval = FALSE}
# Compare networks
compare_13 <- tsnet::compare_gvar(net_1, 
                    net_3,
                    return_all = TRUE)

# Plot test results
test_plot_13 <- plot(compare_13,
                     name_a = "Model A",
                     name_b = "Model B")
```
