The goal of tsnet is to include helpful functions for dynamic network
modelling in psychology and surrounding fields. Currently, the core of
the package is the comparison of Bayesian gVAR models as estimated in
the BGGM package.

## Installation

You can install the development version of tsnet from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bsiepe/tsnet")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r

#>   method               from
#>   get_estimates.lm     bain
#>   get_estimates.t_test bain
#> Registered S3 method overwritten by 'GGally':
#>   method from
